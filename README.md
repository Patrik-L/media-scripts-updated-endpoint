# Media Scripts

This repository contains scripts that are useful for managing media files. Some of them are Plex specific, while others will work with any media files in general. These were previously posted on the Plex Forums, but this repository serves as a more organized home for them.

## General

 - [force-signs](https://github.com/iwalton3/media-scripts/tree/master/force-signs) - Mark subtitle tracks with visible text translations as forced.
 - [media-discard](https://github.com/iwalton3/media-scripts/tree/master/media-discard) - Remove audio and subtitle tracks not in your preferred languages.
 - [subtitle-audio-transfer](https://github.com/iwalton3/media-scripts/tree/master/subtitle-audio-transfer) - Transfer subtitles or audio tracks between files and sync them.
 - [detect-static-image](https://github.com/iwalton3/media-scripts/tree/master/detect-static-image) - Detects video files which are just an image and not actually video.
